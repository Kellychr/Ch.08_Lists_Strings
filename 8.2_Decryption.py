DECRYPTION PROGRAM
------------------
An ENCRYPTION program was used to generate the following secret code. The encryption program converted each character 
of the string into its ASCII decimal number, applied a +/-20 algorithm to it and then converted it back to
characters. Your task is to write a DECRYPTION program to decipher the following secret code. Don't waste time changing 
your program 40 times. Use a FOR loop from -20 to +20 to generate all the possibilities in one run of your program.

Extra Challenge: Instead of printing out 41 lines of text to look at, can you determine a way to just print out the decrypted line only
along with the shift number?
